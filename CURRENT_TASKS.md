## Notes & Development Log

### Development Notes
- âœ… Current Models page has basic CRUD operations implemented
- âœ… API integration is functional for model listing and basic actions
- ðŸ†• **Backend team provided 11 new production-ready endpoints (July 9, 2025)**
- ðŸ†• **Interactive API documentation available at /api-docs**
- ðŸ†• **Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces available**
- Need to add routing for detail pages
- Consider modal vs full page approach for model details
- Priority: Upgrade existing ModelService to use new enhanced endpoints

### Technical Considerations
- Photo upload and management will require file handling capabilities
- Analytics features will need chart/visualization libraries
- Real-time features may need WebSocket integration
- Bulk operations should include progress indicators and cancellation

### Dependencies
- Chart.js or similar for analytics visualization
- File upload library for photo management
- Notification system for real-time updates
- Routing system for navigation

### ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority (Based on New APIs)
1. **Upgrade ModelService** to use new enhanced endpoints
2. **Model Detail Page** using GET /api/admin/models/:id
3. **Analytics Integration** using GET /api/admin/models/:id/analytics
4. **Transaction History** using GET /api/admin/models/:id/transactions
5. **Platform Statistics** using GET /api/admin/models/stats
6. **Enhanced Search** using GET /api/admin/models/search
